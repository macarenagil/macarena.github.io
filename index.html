 <p class="about">
  Hello everyone and welcome to my site! my name is Maria Arroyo. I was born in the south of Spain and I moved alone to New York City seven years ago (I cannot believe has been that long already). 
  I am a senior here at Baruch College, my major is Computer Information Systems and my minor is Communication Studies. 
  
  I am currently interning as a Software Test Engineer for a healthcare startup called Blink Health. I really enjoy working for this company, they are always involved in new projects and I am constantly learning new things.
  For this reason, I would love to keep gaining experience at Blink Health after my graduation in May. In addition, I find my job very because I am part of an excellent team that is contributing to make healthcare affordable for everyone, we are helping people every day. 
 
  Aside from my education and career, I love traveling and my goal is to visit at least a new country every year. Some of my hobbies are attending to live music performances, visiting art exhibitions, trying new restaurants, and meeting new people. 
  I also enjoy swimming, yoga, and horse riding. Last, I have to say that now that my graduation day is approaching, I feel very accomplished. Itâ€™s been a long ride and not an easy one, I gave up a lot of things to make it here.
  Now that I have reached almost all my goals I feel super proud of myself. I stay positive because my family and friends have always encouraged me to follow my dreams and I live in a city full of opportunities that definitely have made me a stronger, ambitious, and independent woman today.</p>
