            <h2> About Me </h2>

            <p>Hello everyone! Welcome to my website! I am Maria Arroyo and I am from Cordoba (Spain). I moved on my own
                to
                New York City seven years ago and I am really glad I did because it has changed my life completely.
                I am a senior here at Baruch College, and I will be graduating this semester with a degree in Computer
                Information Systems and a minor in Communication Studies.
                I am constantly amazed about the power of technology and its ability to transform and improve our lives,
                and
                the critical part design plays in doing so.</p>

            <p>I am currently working part time as a Junior QA Analyst for a healthcare startup called Blink Health. I
                really enjoy working for this company, they are always involved in new projects and I am constantly
                learning
                new things.
                For this reason, I would love to keep gaining experience at Blink Health after my graduation in May. In
                addition, I find my job very rewarding because I am part of an excellent team that is contributing to
                make
                healthcare affordable for everyone, we are helping people every day.</p>

            <p>Some of my hobbies are attending to concerts, visiting art exhibitions, trying new restaurants, and
                meeting
                new people.
                I also enjoy going to the gym, swimming, dancing, and horse riding. Last, I have to say that now that my graduation day is
                approaching, I feel very accomplished. It was a long ride and not an easy one, I gave up a lot of
                things
                to make it here.
                I am very excited about graduation and very proud of myself. I stay positive because my family and friends have
                always
                encouraged me to follow my dreams and I live in a city full of opportunities that definitely have made
                me a
                stronger, ambitious, and independent woman today.<br><br><br><br>
